Legal Compliance: Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
Unauthorized use of cybersecurity tools may violate laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) or similar regulations in other countries. The CFAA is a U.S. federal law that prohibits:

Unauthorized access to computer systems.

Fraudulent activities involving computer networks.

Intentional damage to digital systems or data.

Trafficking in access credentials (e.g., passwords).

Cyber extortion involving threats to digital assets.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) has revised its CFAA enforcement policy to protect good-faith security researchers who conduct ethical hacking to improve security. However, any testing must be done with explicit permission, as violations can lead to criminal penalties.
